Topic Modeling Shakespeare’s Plays

This dataset shows the results of how topic modeling can be fruitfully applied to TEI-encoded plays, which allows scholars to analyze speeches by individual characters. 
Specifically, this dataset centers on Shakespeare’s corpus and its characters who reappear in multiple plays. 
As this research reveals, analyzing plays with topic models while giving special attention to each speaker opens the door for new comparisons, and in turn, expands on previous interpretations of literature.
